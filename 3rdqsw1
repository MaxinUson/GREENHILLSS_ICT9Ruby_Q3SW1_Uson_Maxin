	<h3> Main Characters</h3>
	<table class="container-fluid table striped table-bordered table-hover">
		<tr>
			<td class="table-primary">Lorelai Gilmore</td>
			<td class="table-danger"><img src="https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/characters/test-resources/pics/GILG/1.jpg" height="500" width="500"></td>
			<td class="table-warning">Bubbly, energetic, intelligent, driven. Lorelai worked her way up from maid at the aptly named Independence Inn, learning to be a parent at the same time. Not that she follows any instruction manuals â€“ she raises Rory as only she could. That means coffee- and Chinese food-fueled movie marathons.</td>

		<tr>
			<td class="table-secondary">Rory Gilmore</td>
			<td class="table-info"><img src="https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/MOrKv0FI45WBHeJwwjf7erpT54I/fit-in/1024x1024/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2016/03/21/902/n/37139775/6d3b2f15_edit_img_image_40645247_1458590450/i/Rory-Gilmore-GIFs.png" height="500" width="500"></td>
			<td class="table-success">Quiet, brilliant, full of energy. She's learned a lot from her mother, an outgoing woman with a strong, sarcastic personality. Lorelai passed down not only her tenacity and drive, but also a love of old screwball comedies and snappy dialogue.</td>
